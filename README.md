# assignment_manager
This is a python desktop app made for students who have value their management of assignments/tasks (such as myself). I designed a minimalist front-end GUI using the Tkinter library and connected it to a SQLite 3 built-in database. Not exactly the most aesthetically pleasing but my goal was to make it as easy to navigate as possible with all the required database functionalities, and it certainly met my expectations!
